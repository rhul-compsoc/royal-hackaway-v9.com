The venue is **wheelchair accessible** and has disabled toilets. There are gender neutral toilets in the library next door.

There will be a **quieter hacking room** available for individuals or teams who require a calmer space to work. You're welcome to skip any events if you don't feel comfortable in large or busy spaces.

If you have any questions, feel free to message any Hackaway staff on our Discord server! You can also find out more information about the Windsor building [here](https://www.accessable.co.uk/searches?query=Windsor&location_query=TW20+0EX).
